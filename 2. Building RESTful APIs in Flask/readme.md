Creating RESTful APIs is one of the most common uses of Flask. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses HTTP methods and conventions to create a standardized way of interacting with resources. Flask provides a straightforward way to implement RESTful APIs by utilizing its routing capabilities and supporting HTTP methods.

What is REST?
REST is a set of principles for designing networked applications. REST APIs conform to the following constraints:

Client-Server: The client and server are separate, allowing them to evolve independently.
Stateless: Each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request. No client context is stored on the server.
Cacheable: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not.
Uniform Interface: The resources are identified in the request, and there is a standardized way of interacting with them (e.g., using HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).
Layered System: APIs can be composed of multiple layers, with the ability to use middleware, security, and other services.
1. REST API Principles and Best Practices
When building RESTful APIs, follow these principles and best practices:

1. Use Nouns for Endpoints:
Endpoints should represent a resource (e.g., /users, /products).
Avoid verbs in endpoints like /getUser or /createProduct.
2. Use HTTP Methods Appropriately:
GET: Retrieve data from the server.
POST: Create a new resource.
PUT: Update an existing resource.
DELETE: Remove a resource.
3. Return Appropriate Status Codes:
Use status codes to indicate the outcome of a request:
200 OK: Request was successful.
201 Created: Resource created successfully.
204 No Content: No data returned (usually after DELETE).
400 Bad Request: Invalid request parameters.
404 Not Found: Resource not found.
500 Internal Server Error: Server encountered an error.
4. Use Meaningful Resource Naming:
Use plural nouns for collections (/users for a list of users).
Use singular nouns for single items (/users/{user_id}).
5. Filter and Paginate Responses:
For large datasets, implement query parameters for filtering and pagination (/users?page=2&limit=10).
6. Handle Errors Gracefully:
Return meaningful error messages in the response body, indicating what went wrong.
